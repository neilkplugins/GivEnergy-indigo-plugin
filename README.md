# GivEnergy-indigo-plugin
An indigo plugin to connect to GivEnergy Battery/Inverter.  


# Known issues

  This is being developed without an API instance to test against, so it may not work until confirmed (this is a collaboration) and it is extremely early and minimal functionality
  
  Currently no validation of the API Key or Serial Number and it is hard coded for the number of solar arrays
  
  Future versions will collect Inverter serial numbers from the API, and parse correctly for the number of arrays (if this has a use case)
  
  Documentation via the wiki https://github.com/neilkplugins/GivEnergy-indigo-plugin/wiki, that covers the customs states and actions and configuration options.
